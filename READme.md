# Probabilistic Regression Simulator

This project helps us understand how predictions can vary across a range of possible outcomes â€” not just the average.

## ðŸŒŸ What This Project Does
- Generates fake (synthetic) data that mimics real-world randomness
- Fits **quantile regression models** (e.g., 10th, 50th, 90th percentiles)
- Shows **multiple prediction lines** instead of just one average line
- Visualizes **confidence bands** to show uncertainty in predictions
- Helps explain **why modeling full distributions is better than just one value**

## ðŸ¤” Why This Project Matters
- Most models only predict the average (mean) â€” but real-world data is noisy
- Quantile regression lets us see **what might happen at the low, middle, and high ends**
- This is useful for **finance, risk management, forecasting, and more**

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy and pandas (for data)
- statsmodels (for quantile regression)
- matplotlib (for plotting)

## ðŸ“Œ Goals
- Learn quantile regression through simulation
- Understand uncertainty and prediction ranges
- Create clean, educational visuals to show the concepts
